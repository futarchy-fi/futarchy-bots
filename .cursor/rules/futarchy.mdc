1. Always try to learn things, even in small steps. Learn from all bugs, and register on the [AI_LEARNINGS.md](mdc:AI_LEARNINGS.md) file.

2. Frequently consult the @AI_LEARNING.md files and write also instructions, goals, and subgoal.

3. If you have a complicated task, try to find a smaller task, call it SUBGOAL, write it in the AI_LEARNING, and try to execute and, and most importantly, VALIDATE that the SUBGOAL is resolved, before moving forward. This will help you move forward without getting struck!

4. Do NOT change high-level strategy in order to solve a problem without explicit authorization from a human. If you have questions regarding what you should do, ask first.
