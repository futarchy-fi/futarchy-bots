# Futarchy Bots

A collection of tools for interacting with futarchy markets on Gnosis Chain.

## Tools

### Price Impact Calculator

A tool for calculating the price impact of trades in various pools:

- Balancer sDAI/waGNO pool
- SushiSwap YES conditional pool
- SushiSwap NO conditional pool

The calculator provides accurate price impact calculations for different trade sizes, helping traders make informed decisions.

### SushiSwap V3 Liquidity Provider

A tool for adding and managing concentrated liquidity positions in SushiSwap V3 pools:

- Create new concentrated liquidity positions with custom price ranges
- Increase liquidity in existing positions
- Decrease liquidity from positions
- Collect accumulated fees
- View detailed position information

This functionality allows users to provide liquidity to the YES and NO markets with greater capital efficiency.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Git

### First-time Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/futarchy-bots.git
cd futarchy-bots
```

2. Run the development setup script:
```bash
./scripts/setup_dev.sh
```

This script will:
- Create a Python virtual environment
- Install all required dependencies
- Set up the package in development mode

3. Create a `.env` file with your configuration:
```
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
RPC_URL=your_rpc_url_here
```

### Daily Development

1. Activate the virtual environment:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

2. When dependencies change:
- Run the setup script again to update:
```bash
./scripts/setup_dev.sh
```

## Usage

### Price Impact Calculator

```bash
python price_impact_calculator.py --amount 0.1
```

Options:
- `--amount`: Amount of GNO to calculate price impact for (default: 0.01)

### SushiSwap V3 Liquidity Provider

The liquidity provider functionality is integrated into the main futarchy bot and can be accessed through the CLI menu.

## Experimental CLI (Refactored)

An experimental command-line interface using a refactored MVC-like architecture is available.

### Usage (Experimental CLI)

```bash
# Activate environment
source venv/bin/activate 

# Check balances
python refactored_main.py balances

# Buy GNO with sDAI (executes transaction)
python refactored_main.py buy_gno 0.1 

# Sell GNO for sDAI (executes transaction)
python refactored_main.py sell_gno 0.01
```

### Simulation Mode (`--simulate`)

Several commands support a simulation mode using the `--simulate` flag. This allows you to see the expected outcome of an operation (like a swap or wrap/unwrap) without sending a transaction or spending gas.

**How it works:** The simulator uses `eth_call` to query the blockchain state and predict the results of contract function calls.

**Example Usage:**

```bash
# Simulate buying 0.5 GNO with sDAI
python refactored_main.py buy_gno 0.5 --simulate

# Simulate selling 0.01 GNO for sDAI
python refactored_main.py sell_gno 0.01 --simulate
```

**Sample Simulation Output:**

*   **Buy Simulation (`buy_gno 0.5 --simulate`)**
