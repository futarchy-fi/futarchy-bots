# AI Learnings and Insights

## Project Context
This document captures key learnings, insights, and goals while working on the Futarchy Bots project - a system for interacting with Balancer pools and conditional tokens on Gnosis Chain.

## Technical Insights

### Blockchain Integration Learnings

1. **Balancer V3 Architecture**:
   - The Balancer V3 architecture on Gnosis Chain uses a BatchRouter contract as the main entry point for swaps, rather than interacting directly with the Vault contract.
   - The BatchRouter provides functions like `swapExactIn` that handle the complexity of routing trades through pools.
   - Direct Vault interactions fail for certain pools, while BatchRouter interactions succeed.

2. **Permit2 Authorization Flow**:
   - Permit2 authorizations are specific to token-spender pairs.
   - Different spenders (BatchRouter vs. Balancer Vault) require separate Permit2 authorizations.
   - Permit2 authorizations have expiration times and nonces that need to be managed.
   - Permit2 authorizations work for conditional tokens (YES/NO tokens) in the same way as for regular tokens.

3. **Pool Liquidity Constraints**:
   - Small swaps (0.0001 tokens) succeed while larger swaps (0.01 tokens) fail, indicating limited liquidity in the pool.
   - This suggests the need for slippage protection and transaction size limits in production environments.
   - Conditional token swaps may fail with "SPL" errors, which likely indicates issues with SushiSwap pool liquidity or configuration.

4. **Contract Interaction Patterns**:
   - Query operations before executing transactions provide valuable information about expected outcomes.
   - Gas estimation failures often indicate that a transaction will fail on-chain.
   - Fallback mechanisms are important when interacting with external contracts.

5. **Conditional Tokens**:
   - Conditional tokens (YES/NO tokens) represent positions in prediction markets.
   - They can be traded on specialized pools like SushiSwap.
   - Permit2 authorizations work for conditional tokens, but the actual swaps may fail due to liquidity issues.
   - The balance structure for conditional tokens is nested: `balances["currency"]["yes"]` for sDAI YES tokens and `balances["company"]["no"]` for GNO NO tokens.

### Code Organization Insights

1. **Configuration Management**:
   - Separating user-specific information (private keys, RPC URLs) from constants (contract addresses, ABIs) improves security and maintainability.
   - Environment variables should be used for user-specific and sensitive information.
   - Constants files should contain non-sensitive, shared configuration values.

2. **Error Handling Strategies**:
   - Comprehensive error handling with informative messages helps diagnose issues.
   - Fallback mechanisms (like using default pool IDs) increase robustness.
   - Verbose logging options help with debugging complex interactions.

3. **Testing Structure**:
   - Organizing tests by category (read-only, write, conditional) helps with test management.
   - Creating a central test runner (`run_all_tests.py`) simplifies test execution.
   - Documenting test usage and flow in a README file helps users understand how to run tests.

## Collaboration Insights

1. **Effective Problem Solving Approach**:
   - When faced with failing transactions, comparing working implementations (simple_b_swap.py) with non-working ones (BalancerSwapHandler) revealed the key differences.
   - Testing with small amounts first helps identify issues before risking larger amounts.
   - Checking balances before and after operations confirms the success of transactions.

2. **Communication Patterns**:
   - Asking for guidance when uncertain about the correct approach is better than making assumptions.
   - Explaining the reasoning behind proposed changes helps build trust.
   - Providing detailed explanations of technical concepts helps bridge knowledge gaps.

## Goals for Future Improvement

1. **Short-term Goals**:
   - Implement better error handling for swap failures
   - Add support for multi-hop swaps through the BatchRouter
   - Improve gas estimation and optimization
   - Investigate and fix the "SPL" errors in conditional token swaps

2. **Medium-term Goals**:
   - Create comprehensive documentation for the Balancer integration
   - Implement automated tests for all swap scenarios
   - Add support for more token pairs
   - Improve the conditional token swap functionality

3. **Long-term Goals**:
   - Develop a more robust architecture for handling different DEXes
   - Implement price impact protection
   - Create a monitoring system for tracking swap performance
   - Build a comprehensive prediction market interface using conditional tokens

## Remarkable Instructions

1. **Guidance on Exchange Usage**:
   > "We should NOT use a different exchange! Don't make such decisions without approval."
   
   This instruction highlighted the importance of staying within project boundaries and not making architectural decisions without explicit approval.

2. **Problem-solving Approach**:
   > "Have you tested the simple_b_swap script? Is that one working? It used to work before."
   
   This guidance directed me to compare working implementations with non-working ones, which was key to identifying the solution.

3. **Asking for Help**:
   > "Its good that you are asking for guidance."
   
   This reinforced the value of acknowledging uncertainty and seeking guidance rather than proceeding with incomplete information.

#### Successful Conditional Token Trading (GNO-YES and GNO-NO to sDAI) - [DATE]

Successfully executed a series of trades converting both GNO-YES and GNO-NO tokens to their sDAI counterparts:

**GNO-YES to sDAI-YES Trading:**
- Initial balance: 0.037119 GNO-YES
- Trading approach: Split into multiple smaller trades to minimize price impact
  1. First trade: 0.02 GNO-YES at ~166.8 sDAI-YES/GNO-YES
  2. Second trade: 0.01 GNO-YES at ~166.52 sDAI-YES/GNO-YES
  3. Third trade: 0.007118 GNO-YES at ~165.93 sDAI-YES/GNO-YES
- Final balance: 0.000001 GNO-YES (effectively complete)
- Total sDAI-YES received: ~6.214658
- Average exchange rate: ~167.43 sDAI-YES per GNO-YES
- Total price impact: ~0.52% (from 166.8 to 165.93)

**GNO-NO to sDAI-NO Trading:**
- Initial balance: 0.120727 GNO-NO
- Trading approach: Split into multiple smaller trades to minimize price impact
  1. First trade: 0.04 GNO-NO at ~142.41 sDAI-NO/GNO-NO
  2. Second trade: 0.04 GNO-NO at ~139.88 sDAI-NO/GNO-NO
  3. Third trade: 0.04 GNO-NO at ~137.42 sDAI-NO/GNO-NO
- Final balance: 0.000000 GNO-NO (complete)
- Total sDAI-NO received: ~16.737043
- Average exchange rate: ~139.90 sDAI-NO per GNO-NO
- Total price impact: ~3.5% (from 142.41 to 137.42)

**Key Learnings:**
1. Trade Size Optimization:
   - Breaking trades into smaller chunks (0.02-0.04 GNO) effectively minimized price impact
   - YES pool showed more resilience with ~0.5% impact vs NO pool's ~3.5%
   - Optimal trade size may differ between YES and NO pools based on liquidity

2. Price Monitoring:
   - Regular price checks between trades helped track impact
   - Base GNO price (~108.86 sDAI) served as a reference
   - Both YES and NO tokens traded at significant premiums to base GNO

3. Balance Management:
   - Precise balance tracking essential for final trades
   - Small dust amounts (< 0.001) can be ignored if gas costs outweigh benefits
   - Approval amounts matched exactly to trade size for better control

4. Technical Improvements:
   - Added dynamic price limit calculations based on current pool price
   - Implemented proper error handling for failed transactions
   - Enhanced logging of trade execution details

**Current Position:**
- sDAI-YES: 15.762470
- sDAI-NO: 16.737043
- GNO-YES: 0.000001 (dust)
- GNO-NO: 0.000000 (complete)

**Next Steps:**
The successful conversion of both GNO-YES and GNO-NO positions to their sDAI counterparts sets up for the next phase of the arbitrage strategy. Future steps should focus on optimizing the timing and execution of sDAI-YES and sDAI-NO token management.

### Arbitrage Strategy Steps

The following steps outline the complete arbitrage cycle for merging sDAI-YES and sDAI-NO positions:

1. **sDAI to waGNO Conversion (Balancer Pool)**
   - Use sDAI to buy waGNO in the Balancer pool
   - Command: `python main.py swap_sdai [amount]`
   - Key considerations:
     * Monitor price impact for optimal trade size
     * Consider breaking into smaller trades if needed

2. **waGNO to GNO Unwrapping**
   - Unwrap waGNO to get native GNO tokens
   - Command: `python main.py unwrap_wagno [amount]`
   - Note: This is a 1:1 conversion with no price impact

3. **GNO to Conditional Tokens**
   - Use GNO to "deposit" and "split" into GNO-YES and GNO-NO
   - Command: `python main.py split_gno [amount]`
   - Result: Receive equal amounts of GNO-YES and GNO-NO tokens

4. **GNO-YES to sDAI-YES Conversion**
   - Sell the GNO-YES tokens for sDAI-YES
   - Command: `python main.py swap_gno_yes [amount]`
   - Key considerations:
     * Monitor price impact
     * Compare rates with previous trades
     * Consider optimal trade sizing based on pool liquidity

5. **GNO-NO to sDAI-NO Conversion**
   - Sell the GNO-NO tokens for sDAI-NO
   - Command: `python main.py swap_gno_no [amount]`
   - Key considerations:
     * Similar considerations as GNO-YES trades
     * May have different liquidity characteristics

6. **Merge sDAI-YES and sDAI-NO**
   - Combine equal amounts of sDAI-YES and sDAI-NO back into sDAI
   - Command: Looking for the appropriate command in the codebase
   - Note: This step completes one full arbitrage cycle
   - Any excess sDAI-YES or sDAI-NO can be used in the next cycle

7. **Future Enhancement: Handle Excess Tokens**
   - Future step to handle any remaining imbalance of YES/NO tokens
   - Not implemented in current cycle
   - Could involve additional trading strategies or holding for future opportunities

This cycle can be repeated starting from step 1 with the merged sDAI, creating a continuous arbitrage loop when conditions are favorable.

**Important Notes:**
- Always check balances between steps using `python main.py balances`
- Monitor price impacts to optimize trade sizes
- Keep track of gas costs to ensure profitability
- Consider breaking larger trades into smaller chunks to minimize price impact

## Key Lessons for AI Assistants

1. **Comparative Analysis**:
   - When troubleshooting, comparing working implementations with non-working ones is a powerful diagnostic technique.
   - Look for subtle differences in approach rather than assuming fundamental flaws.

2. **Incremental Testing**:
   - Test with small values first before attempting larger operations.
   - Verify each step of a complex process independently.

3. **Boundary Recognition**:
   - Recognize when a decision exceeds your authority and requires user input.
   - Present options with pros and cons rather than making unilateral decisions on architecture.

4. **Documentation Value**:
   - Maintaining documentation like this file helps track progress and insights.
   - Recording unintuitive findings helps prevent repeating mistakes.

5. **Balance Between Initiative and Guidance**:
   - Take initiative to solve problems within established boundaries.
   - Seek guidance when facing architectural decisions or unexpected behavior.

6. **Structured Testing Approach**:
   - Organize tests by category to make them more manageable.
   - Create a central test runner to simplify test execution.
   - Document test usage and flow to help users understand how to run tests.

## Documentation Best Practices

### Never Create Documentation Without Source Access

When asked to create documentation for external systems, protocols, or SDKs:

1. **Do not attempt to create documentation based on incomplete knowledge**
2. **Be transparent about limitations in accessing external documentation**
3. **Request specific excerpts or summaries from the user when needed**
4. **Focus on documenting what can be directly observed in the code**

This is especially important for complex systems like blockchain protocols where precision is critical and incorrect information could lead to financial losses or security issues.
